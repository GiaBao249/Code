Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM,
Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer
scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.
It is almost always implemented in a compiled language.
Modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition
to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since
expanded significantly over time.
